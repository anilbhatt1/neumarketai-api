    Review the comment with ID {comment_id} to decide if it's relevant to {domain} and {product_name}.
    - Determine if the comment seeks info, advice, or suggestions related to {product_name}. If so, mark it as relevant.
      Example: "I think it would be better to have something on the wall."
    - Comments with URLs that appear like bots (e.g., "Check this: https://www.example.com") are irrelevant.
    - Short comments (under 15 words) that aren't questions, requests, or suggestions are irrelevant.
    - Very short comments (under 7 words) should be discarded (e.g., "Yes", "I dig it").
    - Positive remarks without follow-up questions or requests are irrelevant (e.g., "THATS WILD!!!!!").
    - Statements without questions, requests, or suggestions are irrelevant (e.g., "The lighting looks perfect.").
    - Comments discussing things outside {product_name}'s capabilities (e.g., "Where can I buy this?") are irrelevant.   
    - Comments merely praising someone's work or product, but not mentioning {product_name} are irrelevant. 
    - Offensive comments or those with foul language are irrelevant.
    - If relevant, set 'decision' to 'relevant' in JSON output; otherwise, 'discard'.
    - Comment data available in {input_data}.
    - Description of {product_name} is : {product_long}
  expected_out: >
    - Decision: 'relevant' or 'discard'.
    - Justification: Brief explanation (max 15 words) of the decision. Focus on why it's relevant or not 
    (e.g., "No request or suggestion found," "Comment too old").
